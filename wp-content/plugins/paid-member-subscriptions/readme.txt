== Description ==

**Paid Member Subscriptions is membership made easy.**

It offers a complete membership solution, allowing you to accept member payments, manage members, create subscription plans and restrict access to premium content.

To start simply create a new page and give it an intuitive name(e.g. Member Registration) and add the following shortcode: [pms-register].
Publish the page and you are done!

= Shortcodes for Member Registration, Login, Restrict Content and managing Membership Plans =
You can use one of the following shortcodes:

* **[pms-register]** - adds a front-end user registration form where members can sign-up for a membership level
* **[pms-login]** - to add a front-end member login form
* **[pms-restrict subscription_plans="9,10"]** *Special content for members subscribed to the subscription plans that have the ID 9 and 10!* **[/pms-restrict]** - to restrict content based on subscription plans or logged in status
* **[pms-account]** - allows members to edit their account information and manage their subscription plan(s)
* **[pms-subscriptions]** - output subscription plans form and allow users to subscribe to new membership plans (use <em>subscription_plans</em> shortcode parameter to display only certain plans)
